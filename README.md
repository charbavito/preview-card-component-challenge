## The Challenge
This was a very easy Challenge to do, after all, the proposal was to build a simple and responsive preview card component, with only CSS and HTML. Even though it was pretty easy to do, it was really good for reinforcing the fundamentals of layout build using media queries to achieve responsiveness.

## My Process

As usual I started by configuring the project folder and initializing the version control system and gitignore file. Then I structured all the content sematically in HTML and proceeded to configuring style to desktop version using SASS pre-processor. After finishing the desktop version, I beging the mobile version using media queries. Finally, I finished with the Readme file and the adaptations of the HTML and CSS files according to the validation of the W3C Markup Validation Service website

### What I learned
This was a very easy Challenge to do and despite not having learned anything very new, it was excellent to practice and strengthen the bases of layout, responsiveness, media queries and web development with CSS and HTML only.
